# Product Vision

## Core Purpose
This is a **Course Materials RAG System** - a Retrieval-Augmented Generation application that enables users to query educational course materials and receive intelligent, context-aware responses. The system combines semantic search with AI-powered generation to provide accurate answers about course content.

## Target Users
- Students and learners who need to quickly find information within course materials
- Educators who want to explore course content across multiple courses
- Anyone seeking to understand specific concepts or details from educational content

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Semantic Search**: Query course materials using natural language questions
- **Course Discovery**: Browse available courses and their statistics
- **Contextual Responses**: AI-generated answers that cite specific course sources
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions
- **Multi-Course Support**: Search across multiple courses simultaneously or filter by specific courses

### User Interface
- **Web-based Chat Interface**: Clean, modern chat interface for asking questions
- **Course Statistics Sidebar**: Shows available courses and their titles
- **Suggested Questions**: Pre-built example queries to help users get started
- **Source Citations**: Responses include references to specific courses and lessons

### Technical Capabilities
- **Document Processing**: Automatically processes course scripts and extracts structured content
- **Vector Storage**: Uses ChromaDB for efficient semantic search
- **AI Integration**: Powered by Anthropic's Claude for intelligent response generation
- **Tool-based Architecture**: Modular design with search tools for extensibility

## Problem Solved
The system addresses the challenge of quickly finding relevant information within large volumes of educational content. Instead of manually searching through course transcripts or materials, users can ask natural language questions and receive precise, contextual answers with proper source attribution.
